# 🍄 Mushroom Classification Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of mushroom classification using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to accurately classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their characteristics.

## 📋 Project Overview

The dataset used for this analysis contains various features of mushrooms, such as cap shape, cap color, gill size, and more. The primary objective is to build a classification model that can predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## 📁 Files in the Repository

- **`mushroom-classification-analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## 📊 Data

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available and can be downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom). The dataset includes 22 categorical features and a target variable indicating whether the mushroom is edible (`e`) or poisonous (`p`).

## 🛠️ Project Structure

1. **🔍 Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset, including visualization of feature distributions and relationships.
2. **🧹 Data Preprocessing**: Steps to handle missing data, encode categorical features, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **🤖 Modeling**: Implementation of various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
4. **📈 Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **🔚 Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential improvements for future work.
