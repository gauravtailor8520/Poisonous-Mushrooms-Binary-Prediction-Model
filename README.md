# ðŸš— Waze Project

## ðŸ“œ Background on the Waze Scenario

Wazeâ€™s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Wazeâ€™s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely.

weâ€™ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. In your role, you will analyze user data and develop a machine learning model that predicts user churn.

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Wazeâ€™s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as:

- Who are the users most likely to churn?
- Why do users churn?
- When do users churn?

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may simply lose these users without knowing why.

Our insights will help Waze leadership optimize the companyâ€™s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.

Waze co-workers outside the data team may not have a background in data analysis or be familiar with technical terms and concepts. When communicating with these co-workers, make sure to adjust your language to fit your audience and clearly explain technical terms if necessary.

## ðŸŽ¯ Assignment - 1
For your first assignment, Waze is asking for a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within this project. Remember to take into account your audience, team, project goal, and PACE stages of each task in planning your project deliverable.

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and does not represent Wazeâ€™s actual data.

Wazeâ€™s data team is in the earliest stages of the churn project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

- A project proposal identifying the following:
  - Organize project tasks into milestones
  - Classify tasks using the PACE workflow
  - Identify relevant stakeholders
